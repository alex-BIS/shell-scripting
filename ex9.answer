Difference between DOS/Windows & Unix/Linux line endings
--------------------------------------------------------

* DOS line endings use carriage return (\r) followed by line feed (\n) at the end of a line \r\n
* Unix line endings use only line feed (\n) at the end of a line \n
* command "dos2unix <filename>" will ensure DOS line endings are correctly translated to Unix when transferring
  files from Windows to Linux
